# PortScanner #	    
  This project is a simple port scanner implemented in the Python Programming Language (2.7.9)	    
  The purpose of the project was to familiarize myself with Python 2.	    
  The idea and part of the code was taken by the "Primal Security" website: [example](http://www.primalsecurity.net/0x1-python-tutorial-port-scanner/ "Primal Security - Port Scanner Tutorial)
